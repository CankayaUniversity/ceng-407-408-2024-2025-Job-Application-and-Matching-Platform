Job Application and Matching Platform

This project aims to develop a web platform that connects job seekers with employers. The platform will utilize an AI-powered search engine to analyze candidate profiles and job postings to provide the most suitable matches. Thanks to AI, candidates' social skills, work experiences, and field-specific competencies will be evaluated in a balanced way, and job suggestions will be made based on employers' needs. Additionally, the platform will feature online chat and appointment scheduling between candidates and employers, allowing direct interaction. To enhance user experience, a live support feature will also be integrated to provide immediate assistance. Current job platforms tend to focus mainly on academic success while overlooking candidates' social skills, work experiences, and field-specific competencies. This project aims to address this issue by using AI to provide a more accurate assessment of candidates' overall qualifications and match them with suitable employers. Moreover, the online chat and appointment scheduling features will streamline communication between candidates and employers, making the process more efficient. The live support feature will assist users with any issues they may encounter on the platform.
